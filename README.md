The code consists of two distinct sections.

The first part focuses on analyzing EEG (Electroencephalography) signals to remove similar segments between different electrodes. It starts by defining a function called "remove_segments" that performs this process. First, it identifies identical timestamp marks between the electrodes and retrieves the corresponding segments for those marks. Then, it calculates the Pearson correlation between the segments of each pair of electrodes. If the correlation is greater than or equal to 0.7, the segment with the higher amplitude is retained, and the other one is removed. This process is iteratively performed for different combinations of electrodes, thus optimizing the removal of redundant segments.

The second part of the code works with data matrices and aims to filter unwanted elements from 3x3 submatrices. The original matrices are defined, and all possible 3x3 submatrices are extracted. Then, the unwanted elements from these submatrices are filtered, and the results are printed. This process is repeated for all submatrices.

In both sections of the code, a clear and organized structure is used, with explanatory comments and descriptive variable names to facilitate understanding and maintenance of the code.

In the main section at the beginning of the code, only the obtaining of "segments", "ts", and the selected electrodes is performed.
